### Linting the code base:

```sh
# You should get no output (that means everything is operational).
./run lint
```

#### Sorting Python imports in the code base:

```sh
./run format:imports
```

#### Formatting the code base:

```sh
# You should see that everything is unchanged (it's all already formatted).
./run format
```
